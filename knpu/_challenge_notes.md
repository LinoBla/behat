### Question 1

You've assembled a crack team for a brand new project:
a site where paleontologists and other dinosaur scientists
can send each other important scientific messages, along
with the usual cat photos.

Each scientist will need to register to gain access, and
you - knowing that using BDD will create a better product -
are writing a registration feature. Fill in the 4 feature
lines in `registration.feature`.

ANSWER:

Feature: Registration
  In order to send and receive messages from scientists I know
  As a scientist
  I can register for a new account

## Question 2

For the messaging feature, you and the intern (Bob) are in
a heated debate over how to phrase the business value.
Which if the following is the *best* business value for the
message feature:

A) In order to type messages and click to send them to scientists
B) In order to communicate with other scientists
C) In order to exchange information and resources with other scientists
D) In order to send cat videos

Answer: (C)

Explanation:
Business value is subjective. But to help, forget about the technology
and think about the problem that your user role (scientist) wants to
solve. Both "communicate" and "exchange information and resources"
are pretty good business values, but I like the second, because it
contains a few more details about what the scientists actually
want to do.
