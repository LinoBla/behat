title:  BDD, Behat, Mink and other Wonderful Things

summary: |
    Ready to revolutionize how you develop? In this tutorial, you'll internalize Behavior-Driven Development and how thinking
    about *behavior* will increase the quality and efficiency of your code. You'll become an expert in Behat - the BDD PHP
    framework - and Mink - your key to testing web applications in sophisticated ways that include the ability to test your
    JavaScript pages. We'll also explore the pitfalls of testing with Behat, such as data sanitization, bootstrapping your
    code, and other challenges. By the end, you'll be well on your way to writing high-quality tests for your application
    and - more importantly - approaching development in a totally new light.

    Behat works great with any PHP project, but if you're using Symfony2, we'll give you some special tips to get you rolling.
