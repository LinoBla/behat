title:  BDD, Behat, Mink and other Wonderful Things

summary: |
    **Looking for Behat v2.5 of the tutorial?** See https://knpuniversity.com/screencast/behat-v25.

    Behat is my absolute favorite library to use. First, it let's me think about the *behavior*
    of my features first, *before* I start developing. In this tutorial, we'll do that, and it'll
    change the way you develop. Second, Behat turns that written behavior into functional tests
    against your application. Does your feature behave correctly? Just run the automated robots
    to find out!
    
    Along the way, we'll master Mink - the partner library to Behat - and solve all sorts of common
    problems, like:
    
    * Running scenarios in a real browser
    * Properly waiting or JavaScript events
    * Leveraging Behat hooks
    * Multiple contexts
    * Loading Database fixtures and clearing data
    * Bootstrapping your application (specifically Symfony)
    * Using the authenticated user
    * Tagging scenarios
    * How to put BDD into practice
    * Keeping the velociraptors in their pen.

    Let's do this!
