Welcome to the magical world of Behat, my favorite library. No joke 
this thing is the best. It's about two things:

First, functionally testing your application. Which means writing code that will
open a browser, fill out a form, hit submit and verify text on the other side.

Why test your application? Well, imagine you are in charge of safety at Jurassic
Park, your job is to make sure guests aren't eaten by dinosaurs. You need to be 
certain that the new pterodactyl exhibit that's being put in won't turn off the
electric fence around the velociraptor pen. No tests? Good luck, they know how to
open doors. 

And second, Designing your application. As developers we'll often just start coding
without thinking about what we're building and what the behavior of a given feature 
is going to be like.

Using behavior driven development, which Behat helps you do, you'll actually plan things
out beforehand. 

Imagine a world where communication on your team is perfect, you always deliver exactly
what your client wants, electricity on the raptor fence never goes down and chocolate
ice cream is always free. Yep, that's where we're going. 

Over in the browser, let's surf to the behat documentation.
